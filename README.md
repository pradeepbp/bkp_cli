bkp_cli
=======

GUI/Console based backup utility; works on both Linux and Windows. The script actually creates copies of selected
folders and files to a pre-defined destination (which is a folder named as backup location). Subsequent updates will
cause only the modified folders and files to be backed up, thereby reducing app load and processing time.
